# plasmapR

This is an R package for making plasmid maps using `{ggplot2}`.

## Installation 

> This package is still very early in development and the API may change. The 
> parser for `.gb` files works most of the time but has not been tested 
> extensively.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bradyajohnston/plasmapr")
```


## Example

`plasmapR` provides functions for parsing and plotting .gb plasmid files. 

Once a plasmid has been exported in Genbank format it can be parsed and plotted.

```{r example-plasmid}
library(plasmapR)

plasmid <- read_gb("data/petm20.gb")

p <- plot_plasmid(plasmid)

p
```
